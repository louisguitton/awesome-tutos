## Language Reference

## Language flavors (Redshift, ...)

- [Learn SQL | PopSQL](https://popsql.com/learn-sql)

## Code Style

This SQL guide is mostly outdated. We follow
[corp/dbt_style_guide.md at master Â· fishtown-analytics/corp](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/corp/blob/master/dbt_style_guide.md).

Most of it still applies, but:

- we don't UPPERCASE anymore, we lowercase (less code yelling at you all day)
- regarding commas: you can use leading or trailing commas, but if you're
  looking to wrap your head around the reasons behind one or the other,
  please read [A Dispassionate Examination of the Empirical Evidence
  Regarding Positional Punctuation in SQL](https://mode.com/blog/should-sql-queries-use-trailing-or-leading-commas/)
