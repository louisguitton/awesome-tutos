# SQL Guide

## Language Reference

## Language flavors (Redshift, ...)

## Code Style

This SQL guide is mostly outdated. We follow <https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/corp/blob/master/dbt_coding_conventions.md>.

Most of it still applies, but:

- we don't UPPERCASE anymore, we lowercase (less code yelling at you all day)
- regarding commas: you can use leading or trailing commas, but if you're looking to wrap your head around the reasons behind one or the other, please read https://mode.com/blog/should-sql-queries-use-trailing-or-leading-commas/
