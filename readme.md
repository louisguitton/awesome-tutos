> A curated list of tech tutos to share and to refer back to.

More often than not, I find myself in the need of refering back to a good tutorial I read about a certain piece of tech. Sometimes it's for myself, sometimes it's to share to an intern or to go along a comment in a code review. But every time I look for the link. Hopefully that list will solve that.

## Contents

The reader can refer back to guides as she sees fit.
They might still be work in progress. They provide a structure for
knowledge sharing around a couple areas:

- Python software engineering
- Work that happen in a Data Team
- Machine Learning Engineering and Data Science

Some nice reads don't fit into guides at this time, so I include them in "Others".

## Start Here

Alongside reading those guides, I advise following those courses in order:

- \[ \] [First Day on GitHub | GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/first-day-on-github)
- \[ \] [First Week on GitHub | GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/first-week-on-github)
- \[ \] [DevOps with GitHub Actions | GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/devops-with-github-actions)
